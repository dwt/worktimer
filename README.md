#  What is this

This is a simple time tracker. That means it tracks the time you spend on a project. This allows you to then later accurately bill a client for the time you spent on him.

## What does it do?

- You can add time intervals
- You can set the end time of an interval to 'now' via a shortcut
- You can see the sum of multiple entries by selecting them all in the list
- You can show a weekly summary, for easy copying into bills.
- You can see a live preview of the current intervall length as a preview for easy reference

Thats it. This really is a simple time tracker, that does just enough for my own needs.
