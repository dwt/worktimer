@implementation Worktime

// FIXME need to ensure that the endDate is always on the same day as the startDate

// REFACT: change internal time-format to be a full date
// This would need additional GUI!
// REFACT consider to fix the date on both start and end time to the date that is displayed on the left
// that should make the time computation much easier (and it should also be a computed value, that is expressed as a NSTimeInterval oder NSDateInterval
// then format with NSDateIntervalFormatter mit .timeStyle = NSDateIntervalFormatterShortStyle
// this should have a project / tag, that is auto-selected to the lasts entry tag
// consider to have an easy text entry box, that allows you to enter lines like this: '@sntl', and then starts a line for sntl right now
// I want a weekly commitment, that the app shows when it is reached
// it should also compute and show the overtime
// it could help by adding pomodoros, so it is easier to plan how many pomodoros you invest in a task and then run the timers
// needs to be able to tell the app that a day is 'free' because of feiertag or holiday
// app should track number of holidays and display that
// could show work-time / remaining daily time in the touch bar
// would be really cool, if I could edit the duration, to change the end-time
// for each project, store till when it is billed / and display not billed hours?
// store project hourly rate and display income?

// Formulate migration strategy and what can be done as lightweight migrations

// This model should have two values, start / end.
// Every other value should be derived from these.
// Add automatism that sets the date part of the end time to the date of the start time
/*
 Likely steps to achieve this
 - Follow https://medium.com/@shakya4577/heavyweight-core-data-migration-51570555124b
 - example code: https://github.com/shakya4577/HeavyweightMigration
 - Create second model version that has only the new values start / end (maybe startDate/ endDate)
 - Create MappingModel
 - Map startDate from date+startTime
 - Map endDate from date+endTime
 - Provide methods that still return the old named values
 - with change notifications so the ui can auto update
 - provide method that retuns the date components
 - display the date components with a NSDateComponentsFormatter in the UI
 - update ui to display start / end directly with NSDateFormatter
 */

/*
 - later: consider how to update the endDate from changes to those date components
 - add new field company / tag / job that signifies the company / the job is done for
    - consider a compound field that combines job@company sntl@work, sntl@sprint or the other way around?
    - this could emulate sntl@sick, sntl@holiday to add special time entries that cover for special time
